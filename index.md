# PINO Applications

In this work, we examine the applications of physics informed neural operators (PINOs).  PINOs have demonstrated excellent ability to reproduce results of various test simulations.  Here we stress test PINOs over a wide range of problems including the variations of the wave equation, Burgers equation and the shallow water equations.  The source code for this work can be found at [this repo](https://github.com/shawnrosofsky/PINO_Applications). 
We also provide users with a way to try out our code at Argonne's [Data and Learning Hub for Science](https://www.dlhub.org).
