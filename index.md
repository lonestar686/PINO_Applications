# PINO Applications

In this work, we examine the applications of physics informed neural operators (PINOs).  PINOs have demonstrated excellent ability to reproduce results of various test simulations.  Here we stress test PINOs over a wide range of problems including the variations of the wave equation, Burgers equation and the shallow water equations.  The source code for this work can be found at [this repo](https://github.com/shawnrosofsky/PINO_Applications). 
We also provide users with a way to try out our code at Argonne's [Data and Learning Hub for Science](https://www.dlhub.org).

### Wave Equation 1D
The 1D wave equation was the first test for our PINOs.  This equation computationally simple PDE that is second order in time and models a variety of different physics phenomena.  This equation is given by

where c=1 is our wave speed and with periodic boundary conditions.  

We present results bellow illustrating the ability of the PINO to reconstruct the simulated result for multiple initial conditions.  The differences between the simulated data and the PINO are visually indistinguishable.
